Governor asks that we as a county continue to follow safe social distancing wear masks and limit all non-essential activities and travel.  
On May 15 2020 Del Norte County's plan to move through Stage 2 was approved by the State. In order to implement that plan the Public Health Officer makes the following orders:

Individuals who are unable to remove their facial covering without assistance should not be masked. Children under 12 years of age are not required to be masked but are strongly encouraged to do so. Facial coverings are meant to protect the public from the user in case the user is infected and not yet displaying symptoms. 

Facial coverings are not a substitute for social distancing.

Californians must continue at all times to practice physical distancing minimize their time outside of the home and wash their hands frequently.

On May 15 2020 Del Norte County's plan to move through Stage 2 was approved by the State. In order to implement that plan the Public Health Officer makes the following orders  

Facial coverings. 
a. All persons shall wear facial coverings before they enter any indoor facility besides  their residence any enclosed open space or while outdoors when the person is unable to maintain a six-foot distance from another person at all times. 

b. All persons shall wear facial coverings when interacting with other members of the public or with employees of a business.

social distancing. 

g. More guidance regarding face coverings can be found at:

""Persons in the community who are responsible for mass gathering events need to review the document and start planning on cancelation or postponement or restructuring events in a way
that meets the terms of the guidance document. The key determining factor for most gatherings is the need to preserve a social distance of at least 6 feet (a space around individuals of 6 feet in all directions without any other persons in the space). The other key takeaway is that smaller gatherings that are mostly made up of high-risk persons (such as elders) should be limited to 10 people at a time.
......................................................................................................................................
This will be a further burden for places such as churches and senior gatherings but I would stress that these are the most important venues to take the guidance seriously. We strongly
urge the leadership of such groups to consider alternatives such as limited seating to allow spacing extra shifts or services to accommodate demand and whenever possible use virtual
tools to accomplish the same goals. If a plan that would accommodate the guidance is not immediately available temporary closure is probably the best choice if that is not too
disruptive."""
